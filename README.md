# Promul
Promul is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use relay server and session management implementation for [Unity Netcode for GameObjects](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/).  

Promul is designed to quickly allow independent and small developers to have fully functional peer-to-peer (P2P) gameplay over top of an open-source relay server, allowing players to play together without complicated port-forwarding configurations, and with minimal infrastructure investment and expenditure for the development team.

It works by providing a relay server and wire protocol for clients, allowing players to both host and join games using Unity's Netcode for GameObjects library. It ships with its own UDP-based networking solution, which can be used independently of the relay protocol.
  
Promul uses a heavily-modified version of the [LibNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) library for its internal networking, converting the library from a thread-based non-async model to a Task-based Asynchronous Programming (TAP)-based implementation.
Technical details of the networking are explained in engineering section below.
  
Promul is intended to be a free and open-source alternative to [Unity Relay](https://unity.com/products/relay). It supports join secret-based session management, with a REST API for creating and deleting sessions, and an admin UI for managing active sessions.

## Setup
#### Relay server and API
Clone this repository and build and run the program under [/src/Promul.Server~](/src/Promul.Server~) or build and run the provided docker image. The relay server will bind on UDP port 4098 while the API server will bind on TCP port 3000.

To create a new session, call `PUT /session/create`. The API will respond with the join code.

#### Relay client (Transport)
Install the transport by adding it in the Unity Package Manager by git URL:  
`https://github.com/jacksonrakena/Promul.git`
  
Next, add `PromulTransport` to your NetworkManager GameObject. Set the `Address` and `Port` to the address and port of your relay server.  

Example:  
![Alt text](example.png)  
  

You should now be ready to use Promul as a relay server for your Unity project. You can call `NetworkManager`'s `StartHost`/`StartClient`/`StartServer` methods as normal.

### Transit layer
Promul's included networking solution is a very heavily modified version of the amazing [LibNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) by Ruslan Pyrch.

Promul is *probably* compatible with LibNetLib clients and servers. I don't know, and I don't check.  
Compatibility with LibNetLib is not a goal of Promul.

#### Differences from LibNetLib
Among other differences:
- The library requires .NET Standard 2.1.
    - This limits the Unity versions that can use the library, but also
      allows the library to use newer constructs such as `ArraySegment<T>`.
- The `NetDataReader` and `NetDataWriter` classes have been removed in favour of `BinaryReader` and `BinaryWriter` from `System.IO`.
    - This means support for `INetSerializable` has been removed. Clients are expected to create extension overloads for `BinaryWriter.Write` and `BinaryReader.Read{Type}`.
- The logic and receive threads have been removed, in favour of a long-running `Task` spawned by the `NetManager`.
- Most of the library's blocking methods have been replaced with Task-based Asynchronous Programming (TAP) methods, using `Task`. This requires
  a significant rewrite of most parts of the library.
- NAT punch-through and manual mode have both been removed.
    - The transport will now put transport events onto a queue,
      and `NetworkTransport#PollEvents` will dequeue events and pass them to Unity Netcode.
- `NetManager#Start` has been replaced by `PromulManager#ListenAsync`, which will begin infinitely looping, waiting for incoming messages.
    - This method will block, so in the Unity transport, it is spawned on an un-awaited `Task`.
    - Servers are expected to use a paradigm such as `BackgroundService` to run the long-running `Task`.
- Documentation has been improved.
- `NetPacket` no longer has jurisdiction over its data. It is a wrapper around an `ArraySegment<byte>`.
- Most (if not all) usages of `byte[] data, int offset, int count` have been replaced with `ArraySegment<byte>`.
- `INetBasedListener` and related classes have been removed. All events
  are invoked on the `PromulManager` class as
  regular CLR `event` types.
- In many classes, extraneous overloads have been removed in favour of default parameters.
### Protocol layer
Promul's Unity relay uses its own wire protocol over the transit layer. The protocol is shown in the following diagram:

    Host (ID 0)->>+Relay API: PUT /session/create
    Relay API->>Relay: Creates session
    Relay API->>-Host (ID 0): Sends join code "KDS92F" + connection info
    
    Host (ID 0)->>Relay: UDP Connect (KDS92F)
    Client (ID 1)->>+Relay API: PUT /session/join KDS92F
    note right of Relay API: Join code is transferred out-of-band

    Host (ID 0)->>+Relay: 0x00 DATA, target=1,
    Relay->>-Client (ID 1): 0x00 DATA, author=0
    note right of Host (ID 0): author field becomes target when sending to relay
    end

    Client (ID 1)--xRelay: Connection lost
    Relay->>+Host (ID 0): 0x12 CLIENT_DISCONNECTED
    note right of Relay: Relay notifies host of disconnection
    
    Host (ID 0)--xRelay: Connection lost
    Relay->>Relay API: Destroys session
```
